## SRT Rational
This document attempts to capture the rational behind vertical caving gear and techniques. The scope is broad and these ideals should be applicable to most but maybe not all karst topography.

### Gear
- Harness - Type and fit
- Cowstail
  - Locking or non-locking
  - Length of short cowstail
- Length of long cowstail
- etc


### Techniques
- Crossing rebelays
  - Ideally
  - When the loop is too long
  - When the loop is too short
